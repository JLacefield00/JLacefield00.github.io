	    <h2>Mark Andreessen:</h2>
        
		<p> A self-taught researcher and writer, Anderneese has spent over a decade studying geopolitics, historical conflicts, and alternative theories related to global security. His focus is on the intersection of political power, military technology, and public perception. Through a combination of skepticism and academic rigor, Anderneese has cultivated a reputation for questioning the mainstream narratives about war, weapons, and international diplomacy.

		<h2>Owen Benjamin:</h2>
        
		<p>Transitioning from comedian to conspiracy theorist began in earnest around the mid-2010s when his public persona started to shift. Initially known for his stand-up comedy and appearances on mainstream platforms like YouTube and Comedy Central, Benjamin began to use his platform to question the veracity of commonly accepted historical events. His rhetoric increasingly aligned with alternative media outlets and anti-establishment viewpoints, leading him to publicly reject the narratives around events like 9/11, the moon landing, and, most notably, nuclear weapons.
