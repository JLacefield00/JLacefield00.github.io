	<h2>Our current research</h2>
	
	<p>
	1. Historical Skepticism
		
	Skeptics argue that the footage and photos of nuclear tests, like those conducted during the Manhattan Project or at sites like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are fabricated or staged.
	They suggest that geopolitical motivations during the Cold War led to a fabricated arms race between global powers to create fear and control populations.
	</p>

	<p>
	2. Scientific Feasibility

    Critics argue that nuclear explosions as depicted are scientifically improbable or exaggerated, citing inconsistencies in visual evidence or misinterpreting physics.
    They question the ability to manage reactions like nuclear fission or fusion on such a large scale.

	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	
	3. Motivations for Deception
	
	Skeptics propose that the idea of nuclear weapons serves as a powerful tool for fear-based governance and geopolitical leverage without requiring actual deployment.
	They argue that nuclear disarmament talks, treaties, and inspections are theater meant to reinforce belief in these weapons.
		
	</p>

	<p>
	4. Hiroshima and Nagasaki

    Some skeptics argue that the devastation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was caused by conventional bombings, not nuclear bombs. They point to survivors' accounts of fires and destruction that could also result from non-nuclear attacks.
	The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be attributed to massive conventional bombings rather than nuclear detonations.
	Survivors describe intense fires, which could result from firebombing campaigns similar to those seen in Tokyo and Dresden during World War II.
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	5. Visual Evidence
	
	Footage of nuclear tests shows what some consider inconsistencies in lighting, camera angles, or effects that lead them to suspect the images were staged.
	No member of the general public has ever witnessed a nuclear explosion firsthand, and all known footage is provided by governments or organizations with vested interests in maintaining the narrative.
	Videos and photographs of nuclear tests often show visual inconsistencies, such as abrupt cuts, unrealistic lighting effects, or staged environments.
	
	</p>

	<p>
	6.The Arms Race as Political Theater

	The nuclear arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union was a geopolitical strategy to maintain control over populations through fear.
	Nuclear weapons served as a deterrent only in theory, as no actual nuclear war occurred despite decades of tensions.
