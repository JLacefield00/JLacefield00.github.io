		<p>Car drifting is one of the fastest-growing subdisciplines within motorsport,
		 as smoking tyres and mind-blowing driving manoeuvres continue to fascinate. 
		 Many young people will know about drifting from The Fast and the Furious 
		 films, but as a motorsport, it goes much further back than the movie 
		 franchise...Drifting is a sport that focuses on a particular driving technique
		 of the same name, which has been used in other well-known motorsports, such 
		 as rally and speedway racing, for numerous years. Car drifting is all about 
		 using oversteer to get the vehicle to drive sideways through corners. This 
		 has to happen at a high speed and while the driver remains in full control 
		 of the car. </p>

		<h1>My Response </h1>
        
		<p>Drifting is a sport that has a very long and complex history in motorsports.
			I was one of those introduced to the motorsport through the Fast and Furious franchise.
			I deep dove into it, as a fan of the motorsport and japanese cartoons and comics
			i gravitated towards shows such as "Initial D", "Wangan Midnight", "MF Ghost"; and manga 
			"Jigoro Jigorou", "Over Rev!", "countcha". all of these which revolve around motorsport drifting
			but on the streets or togue of Japan. As a kid, thinking this was only in japan thought 
			"how cool would it be to drive like that here..." only to find out a few years later
		with the help of youtube and finding out specifics of the cars that I too could drift. 
	    I personally find this motorsport not only a way to control your car and push the mechanics to the limits
	but its also a form of style, dressing your car up in redicilous body pannels, paint in obonixious colors 
and to livery style the car in as many stickers of brands and sponosorships as possible. the art of drifitng will 
forever be a part of my life and hopefully others feel the same. 		</p>
